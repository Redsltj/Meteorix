# Meteorix

This is our work on the Meteorix project, whose goal is to observe the ISS above Paris with the CubeSat satellite and analyze the data. We are working on using a ground camera to do those observations ; we need to write a code to control the exposure time and the gain of the camera, as well as simulate the passage of a meteor using the Fakeor simulation.
The files Camera_Control and ISS2 is ours, created in February 2024 at the same time as this repository; the others are the previous group's work. The file ISS2 is the most complete version of the meteor simulation.
